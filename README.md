# Rabi-Ribi Randomizer
Randomizes items in Rabi-Ribi maps

[Download](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wcko87/rabiribi-randomizer/build/artifacts?branch=dev) [branch: dev]

Note that this is a command-line tool. A UI for the randomizer is also currently in development. It can be found [here](https://github.com/AzureHakua/rabiribi-randomizer-ui).

### How to use
Here's a 1-minute guide to how to run the randomizer. Make do with this until I get around to writing a proper guide.

1. download randomizer from above link
2. put original maps into original_maps folder
3. create folder called generated_maps (next to the original maps folder)
4. run RabiRibiRandomizer.bat

The randomized maps can now be found in the generated_maps folder.

You can modify `config.txt` to choose which items you want to shuffle (along with some other settings)
